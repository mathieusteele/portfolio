# Overview

As someone who loves to solve problems, I have been fascinated with computers from an early age. I learned to overcome challenges and use technology to make life easier and more organized. This portfolio will showcase some of my ongoing learnings and experiments as I stretch my wings.

By creating this, I want to be more transparent and accountable with what I learn so that I can help others to learn as well.
